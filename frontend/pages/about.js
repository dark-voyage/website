            Hello dear visitor! Iâ€™m Sokhibjon Orzikulov, who is famous under the nickname Genemator.
            <br />
            <br />
            Iâ€™m glad to see you visit my website. For the beginning, let me introduce myself:
            <br />
            Iâ€™m a Senior Full-Stack developer with more than 7 years of experience.
            Although I professionally code using 7 different programming languages as JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, C, C++, Assembler, Python2, Python3.
            I mainly use C++ for its total control and wide range of functions.
            <br />
            <br />
            That said, my knowledge is not limited to coding.
            I am also a specialist in creating 3D driven video and photo.
            Besides, I prefer Cinema 4D as 3D engine and utilize Adobe Products for editing purposes.
            I can also create different songs and music for my projects by using special applications on a professional level.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the time being, I am a second-year student at Westminster International University in Tashkent. My nationality is Uzbek and Iâ€™m only 19 years old ðŸ˜Ž
